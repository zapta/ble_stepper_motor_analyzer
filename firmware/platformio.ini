# Use the ZADIG tool to change "Dual RS232-HS (Interface 0)"
# to WinUsb. This settings seems to get lost once in a while and need
# to be redone. Need to enable list of all devices in Zadig to have
# it listed in the Zadig UI.  When not set, the erros in the debugger
# terminal are:
#   Error: libusb_open() failed with LIBUSB_ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED
#   Error: libusb_open() failed with LIBUSB_ERROR_NOT_FOUND
